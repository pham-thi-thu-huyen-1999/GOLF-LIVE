  "content": "In exactly 36 years of the Official World Golf Ranking Scottie Scheffler becomes the 25th player to reach No.1, the ninth player from the USA and the sixth youngest.Scheffler moved to the top of the Official World Golf Ranking with an emphatic victory at the 2022 WGC - Dell Technologies Match Play, his third title in his last five starts and six weeks after his first PGA TOUR victory.“I never got that far in my dreams,” Scheffler said in the trophy ceremony before choking up and wiping away tears, a rare show of emotion for the 25-year-old Texan. “I just play golf. I love competing. I'm happy to be out here, you know?”One year after losing in the championship match, Scheffler never trailed against Kevin Kisner, building a 3-up lead through six holes and giving him no chance to catch up. Scheffler closed him out with a par on the 15th for a 4-and-3 victory.He had to hold off a stirring fightback from Dustin Johnson in the semi-finals but victory rarely looked in doubt against Kisner as Scheffler banished the heartbreak of losing in the final at last year's event.Corey Conners finished third with a 3 & 1 victory over Johnson in the third-place match.Scheffler's ascent to the top of the world game comes just 42 days after he claimed his first US PGA Tour title, beating the previous record held by Tiger Woods by 210 days.\"I never really got that far in my dreams,\" said an emotional Scheffler. \"I never made it that far. I just love playing golf and I love competing and I'm just happy to be out here.\"I don't feel like number one in the world. I feel like the same guy I was four months ago and I hope that doesn't change.\"Life is good. Life has been good to me for the past few years. I'm just really pleased with today's results and I just couldn't be happier.\"Getting denied here in the final last year was definitely tough and it would have stung even worse having to do that two years in a row.\"I got off to a good start this afternoon, made some nice putts and just kept my head down and kept playing some good golf.\"",

  "__v": 0,
  "content": "PGA Tour – The PLAYERS ChampionshipIn a dynamic conclusion to five days of bad weather and high drama, Cameron Smith one-putted eight of his last nine holes to win the PLAYERS Championship moving to a career best of World No.6.Leading by two on the par-3 17th hole, 135 yards to the hole on an island green, Smith split the difference in the 12 feet that separated the flag from the water. The ball ended up 4 feet away and the Australian made his record-tying 10th birdie of the round.Smith punched out from the pine straw right of the 18th fairway all the way into the water. After a penalty drop, his 60-yard wedge spun next to the hole to 3 feet for a bogey and a 6-under 66, giving him a one-shot victory over Anirban Lahiri of India.Lahiri, who started the final round with a one-shot lead, birdied the 17th and needed one more to force a playoff. He came up short of the green, and his pitch was below the cup all the way. He closed with a 69.Paul Casey shot 69 and was the victim of a horrible break on the 16th hole when he was in position to edge closer to the lead.Smith, who finished at 13-under 275, won for the second time this year, and the fifth time in his PGA TOUR career, and picked up $3.6 million from the $20 million purse, the richest in golf. He earned a staggering 600 FedExCup points.This was about more than money, more than the three-year exemption he earned to the four majors and a five-year exemption on the PGA TOUR.Sunshine and DP World Tour - MyGolfLife Open hosted by Pecanwood 2022Pablo Larrazábal claimed his sixth DP World Tour title as he defeated Adri Arnaus and Jordan Smith in a play-off at the 2022 MyGolfLife Open hosted by Pecanwood. Larrabal moved back in to the Top 200 at World No.116.The Spaniard had entered the day two shots off the lead at Pecanwood Golf and Country Club but soon hit the front and engaged in an enthralling battle with Arnaus and Smith at the top of the leaderboard.With the trio inseparable after 72 holes, they headed back to the 18th tee and although all three of them hit stunning approaches, Arnaus could not make his birdie putt and it was left to Larrazábal and Smith to go again.While Larrazábal found the fairway, Smith was in the rough and it was the 38-year-old who put his second to four feet for another birdie and the victory, with Smith three-putting from off the green for a bogey.The Spanish duo had carded rounds of 67 to finish the week at 22 under, where they were joined by Smith after a 65.PGA Tour of Australasia - TPS Hunter Valley, Hosted by Jan Stephenson & Peter O'MalleyAaron Pike won his third PGTA victory at the shortened TPS Hunter Valley over a three-hole playoff.Pike earned 6 Ranking points moving from World No 564 to 401.Professional Golf Tour of India - Mujib Borsho Chattogram Open 2022India’s Kshitij Naveed Kaul cruised to a comfortable six-shot win after a solid final round display of four-under 68 at the Mujib Borsho Chattogram Open jumping 203 spots to World No. 512.The 21-year-old Kaul, the overnight leader by five shots, drove home the advantage scoring eight birdies at the cost of two bogeys and a double-bogey in round four to total 19-under 269 at the INR 50 lakh event and register his third triumph on the PGTI. Kshitij collected a prize money cheque worth Rs. 8,08,250 that lifted him from 10th to first position in the TATA Steel PGTI Order of Merit.Bangladesh’s leading star Md Siddikur Rahman (71-66-69-69), who was overnight tied second, finished as runner-up at 13-under 275 after his last round of 69.Kshitij Naveed Kaul, who won his last PGTI event in November 2021, had an eventful front-nine as he made five birdies but dropped a bogey and a double-bogey. Kshitij’s front-nine featured two long conversions, two excellent bunker shots and a fantastic approach shot that landed within inches of the flag. He had nine one-putts on the front-nine.With his commanding lead still intact, Kaul closed out the match with a steady back-nine sinking three birdies against a lone bogey. He ended up with the day’s best score of 68 and birdies on all the four par-5 holes.",

  "__v": 0,
  "content": "The youth explosion in golf has hit new heights with the top five players in the world all under 30 for the first time in the history of the game - Rahm 27, Morikawa 25, Hovland 24, Cantlay 29 and Scheffler 25.The closest to the Top 5 being under the age 30 came in Week 4 2016 with the Top 4 ranked players - Spieth 22, Day 28, McIlroy 26, and Fowler 27.PGA Tour - Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by MastercardIn a final round that featured some of the toughest scoring conditions in four decades, Scheffler made key putts to save two unlikely pars, followed with a pair of lag putts and closed with an even-par 72 for a one-shot victory.Scheffler now has two PGA TOUR titles in the last month, having picked up his first victory at the WM Phoenix Open. He breaks into the Top 5 for the first time in his career.The scoring average was 75.48, by a fraction lower than it was a year ago. Only 10 players finished the tournament under par.Billy Horschel was the last player with a shot at catching Scheffler with a 30-foot birdie putt on the last hole that never really had a chance. Horschel shot 75 and tied for second along with Tyrrell Hatton (69) and Viktor Hovland (74).Hovland was still tied for the lead until catching a plugged lie in the front bunker on the 17th and having to two-putt from 50 feet on the fringe for bogey. Needing a birdie on the last hole to catch Scheffler, with whom he was paired, the Norwegian missed from 18 feet.In his final two holes Scheffler two-putted from 45 feet, the ball coming within inches of going in, for par on the 17th. And from deep rough left of the 18th fairway, he got it onto the green to just inside 70 feet. That putt stopped inches away, leaving a tap-in par and ultimately a big win at Arnie's place.DP World Tour - Magical Kenya OpenWu Ashun enhanced his record as the DP World Tour's most successful Chinese golfer as he became a four-time winner with victory at the 2022 Magical Kenya Open presented by Absa.The 36-year-old entered the final day at Muthaiga Golf Club four shots off the lead but never looked back after making four birdies in a row from the seventh, signing for a closing 65 and a 16 under par total making his way back into the Top 200 at World No.158.Canadian Aaron Cockerill, South African Thriston Lawrence and German Hurly Long finished four shots back but Wu's victory rarely looked in doubt on the back nine as he became the sixth different winner from a sixth different country on the 2022 DP World Tour.Wu became the third Chinese winner in DP World Tour history when he won the 2015 Volvo China Open and since then he has added wins in Austria and the Netherlands, with this win moving him two victories ahead of countryman Li Haotong.A two-time winner on the Japan Golf Tour, he will move up to sixth on the DP World Tour Rankings in Partnership with Rolex after triumphing in his 158th appearance with his wife and 13-week-old baby watching on in Nairobi.\"It's a big celebration, I'm so happy with my family here,\" he said.Asian Tour - International Series ThailandAmerican Sihwan Kim finally secured his first victory as a professional after over a decade long wait when he claimed the International Series Thailand at Black Mountain Golf Club. The American moves back into the Top 200 for the first time since April 2019, to World No. 189.The in-form 33-year-old, who has been in the final pairing on Sunday at three of the last six Asian Tour events, fired an inspired nine-under-par 63 to beat Thailand’s great hope of the future Phachara Khongwatmai by two strokes.Phachara, the overnight leader chasing his second Tour victory, had no answer to Kim’s round and shot a 68.South African Ian Snyman and Itthipat Buranatanyarat from Thailand finished two shots further back tied for third after rounds of 64 and 67 respectively.Sihwan Kim, who turned professional in 2011, has recorded eight top-four results on the Asian Tour since 2018, including two runner-up finishes.Today’s victory is the culmination of a fine run of form recently which has seen him finish joint fourth at the Blue Canyon Phuket Championship, fourth in the SMBC Singapore Open, and tied second in the Royal’s Cup last week.PGA Tour - Puerto Rico OpenRyan Brehm went out Sunday and ran away with the Puerto Rico Open for his first TOUR title and jumps 491 spots to World No. 282.The 35-year-old Brehm birdied five of the first 11 holes at windy Grand Reserve and beat Max McGreevy by six strokes.Three-strokes ahead entering the day, Brehm shot a 5-under 67 to finish at 20-under 268 in the make-or-break final start on a minor medical extension. He got the extension after he had to withdraw from the Zurich Classic last year because of COVID-19.“It might sound like Bill Belichick or Nick Saban here, but honestly, wasn’t thinking about the impact of my status or anything this week,” Brehm said. “I think that’s probably the real lesson here. I have people on my team that will do that for me. Really, I just need to put my head down and hit good golf shot after good golf shot. That’s my job and I’m going to trust people around me to do their job and they can take care of all those details for me.”Sunshine and Challenge Tour - Mangaung OpenOliver Hundeboll Jorgensen carded a six under par final round 66 to secure a dramatic victory at the Mangaung Open with a 21 under par total leaping from World No. 965 to 398.The Dane entered round three five shots off the pace but carded seven birdies and just one bogey in difficult conditions at Bloemfontein Golf Club to record a one-shot victory over South African duo Luke Jerling and Tristen Strydom, who shared second place on 20 under par.The 22-year-old started the final round slowly before a birdie at the tenth hole ignited a back nine of 31 to set the target in the clubhouse.Hundebøll watched on as players in the final three groups failed to convert birdie chances, and the Dane admitted he was not expecting to have his hands on the trophy when he signed his card.“It feels amazing,” he said. “I still don’t quite believe it to be honest, especially after the front nine. I managed to put together a strong back nine and the conditions felt like I was playing in Denmark. I’m used to these conditions and the key moment was making a birdie at the tenth hole after my bogey at nine. The putts started to roll in after that and it felt amazing.Professional Golf Tour of India - Glade One Masters 2022Manu Gandas of Gurugram coasted to a comfortable three-shot win at the Glade One Masters 2022 as he totaled eight-under 208 following his two-under 70 in the final round at the Glade One Golf Resort & Club.Chandigarh’s Harendra Gupta finished runner-up at a total of five-under 211 after setting a new course record of seven-under 65 in round four of the Rs. 40 lakh event. Harendra improved upon Aalaap I L’s previous course record of 67 set during round three on Thursday.The first two rounds of the second tournament of the 2022 TATA Steel PGTI season comprised nine holes each. The third and fourth rounds comprised 18 holes each. The tournament was played over a total of 54 holes. The par for the course in the third and fourth rounds was 72.Manu, the overnight leader by two shots, came up with four birdies featuring three long conversions on the front-nine to open up a mammoth seven-shot lead over the chasing pack. Gandas, the runner-up at last year’s inaugural edition, sank a birdie on the opening hole followed by three consecutive birdies from the seventh to the ninth. He landed his approach from 110 yards to within a couple of feet of the flag on the ninth.The 25-year-old Manu, who didn’t look at the leaderboard through the day, made bogey-birdie on the 10th and 11th before making pars all the way till the 17th. On the 18th, he found the water to drop a double-bogey.Manu, who bagged his second career title, collected the winning cheque worth Rs.6,46,600 which moved him up from sixth to first place in the PGTI Order of Merit.Alps Tour Golf – Red Sea Little Venice Open 202217 year old French amateur Oihan Guillamoundeguy, won the Red Sea Little Venice Open 2022 at Sokhna Golf Club (course B+C) with an impressive total score of -24 (65-64-63).The young golfer, coming directly from the Qualifying School held in November last year, maintained the lead since R2 and demonstrated to be able to compete at an incredible level.He had a strong start, scoring 3 birdies on the first 4 holes and finishing the front nine with 1 bogey and 1 eagle. Then, he faced the back nine with steady mind. He holed 3 birdies and another eagle for a daily total of -9. “This victory is incredible. I’couldn’t even believe it yet. The main goal was to stay focussed on my game and I managed to do it very well , I just scored 2 bogeys in 3 days! I putted very well throughout all the three rounds. Today, as always, I’ve been asking my father some advices on the greens and he helped me to hole some putts, too”.Guillamoundeguy, a first-time winner on a professional tournament (one of the youngest winner of all time), left Spaniard Jorge Maicas, 24 , 8 strokes back (-16, 68-66-66). Maicas scored a very solid 3rd round in 66 strokes with 7 birdies and just 1 bogey. He played consistently throughout the three days. “I’m very happy about how I worked on my game and this paid off with this performance here at Red Sea Little Venice Open 2022. I had a solid start which is what everyone wants from the first holes. Then I finished with 4 birdies in a row from 14th to 17th which is even greater”.Alps Tour Golf - New Giza Open 2022Tomas Bessa won the weather-shortened 2022 New Giza Open.Due to the extreme weather conditions, the 3rd round of the 2022 New Giza Open has been cancelled.After the final round started, the wind got stronger, more than expected. The ball couldn’t stay at rest on the greens and the game became unfair. Therefore, the Committee decided to cancel the final round and the results after the second round stood for the whole tournament.Therefore, the winner of 2022 New Giza Open is Portuguese Tomas Bessa, who scored a total of 131 strokes (-13) in 2 days (66-65).Bessa, 25 years old, is a first-time winner on the Tour since he started as a professional player back in 2019. He played consistently during the whole tournament and came out after a great second round thanks to 9 birdies and just 2 bogeys. “It’s awesome to see all the hard work paying off. I’ve been training myself a lot to play here on the Alps Tour and I’m very proud about my game and about the feelings I had on the course. It is very hard to win on the Alps Tour because there is plenty of great players and I’m really happy with this first title”.Two players are tied on the second place, just one stroke back: Spaniard Joel Moscatel and French amateur Julien Sale.",

  "__v": 0,
  "content": "PGA Tour - The Honda ClassicSepp Straka trailed by five shots entering the final round and tapped in for birdie in the rain on the final hole to beat Shane Lowry by one shot to become the first Austrian winner in PGA TOUR history. He shot a 4-under 66 on Sunday to finish at 10 under moving 93 spots to World No. 83.Lowry shot his third consecutive round of 67, his 9 under total for the week coming up one short. First-round leader Kurt Kitayama (68) was alone in third at 8 under, and Daniel Berger — who led by six shots with 19 holes left in the tournament — simply fell apart Sunday, his round of 74 leaving him 7 under for the week and three shots behind Straka.Lowry needed to make a 45-footer for birdie on the final hole to force a playoff. It missed, and with that, The Honda Classic had a new champion — one who came into the week ranked No. 176 in the world, has never been higher than No. 129 on that list, and whose claim to fame as a pro probably was being the first round leader at the Tokyo Olympics last summer.“The third round, I definitely didn’t have my best stuff,” Straka said. “I just hung in there and grinded out a good round. I hit the ball really nice today and really could take advantage.”The victory ensures that Straka — who played his college golf at Georgia — will play the Masters in April. His wife took a flight in to be at the course on Sunday, just in case, and Straka hadn’t even seen her until he got to the practice green before teeing off.Sunshine and Challenge Tour - Jonsson Workwear OpenJC Ritchie made it back-to-back wins after he secured a wire-to-wire six-shot victory at the Jonsson Workwear Open continuing his climb up the Ranking from the start of the year at World No. 304 to World No.151.The ten-time Sunshine Tour winner posted a one under par final round of 71 at Durban Country Club to reach 26 under par and claim his second victory in as many weeks after successfully defending his Bain’s Whisky Cape Town Open title last week.Ritchie admitted he found it much tougher today but remained resilient to record two closing birdies and finish six shots clear of Belgium’s Christopher Mivis, who at one stage came within touching distance of the lead, reducing Ritchie’s advantage to two after an eagle at the 14th hole.“It was tough out there today,” he said. “I’ve never played this golf course with this much wind before so I knew it was going to be different and the golf course showed its teeth today. I found it tough early on but luckily towards the end of the round I was able to figure it out and get the job done.“My girlfriend came up to me after the 14th hole and asked me if I wanted to know the scores,” he added. “She told me Mivis was 22 under and that surprised me. I had a game plan for the last three holes for the week and that was to make par at 16 and run, I felt like I could create a birdie opportunity at 17 and then 18 owed me one. I wanted to birdie it yesterday but found a bad lie in the bunker. Getting two birdies on the way home made it extra special.”Asian Tour - Royal's Cup 2022Chinese-Taipei’s Chan Shih-chang claimed a magnificent wire-to-wire victory in the Royal’s Cup today to secure his second victory on the Asian Tour in the space of four months moving to World No. 234 from 388.Chan closed with a four-under-par 68 to finish with an impressive winning total of 23 under for a three-shot win over Thailand’s Sadom Kaewkanjana and American Sihwan Kim.Sadom also returned a 68 while Sihwan fired a 70, in the second event of the season on the Asian Tour.Thailand’s Nitithorn Thippong and Bio Kim from Korea, finished three strokes further back, in a tie for fourth after rounds of 66 and 68 respectively.Thailand’s Jazz Janewattananond closed with a 65 in a group of players tied sixth to suggest the 2019 Asian Tour Order of Merit champion is starting to rediscover his best form.It looked like being a much closer finish to the US$400,000 event when Chan Shih-chang started the day with a one-shot lead over Sihwan before the American drew level with him on 21 under after nine holes.Professional Golf Tour of India - Gujarat Open Golf Championship 2022 presented by Gujarat TourismKarandeep Kochhar claimed the title on a dramatic final day at the Gujarat Open Golf Championship 2022 presented by Gujarat Tourism moving 134 spots to World No.441.Chandigarh-based Karandeep (64-75-69-70), who was overnight tied fourth and two off the lead, came from behind with a steady two-under 70 on day four to sign off with a 10-under 278 total and wrap up his fourth title at the Rs. 40 lakh event.Arjun Prasad (73-65-70-71), who like his good friend Kochhar was also overnight tied fourth, came within striking range of his maiden title before narrowly missing out. The Delhi golfer totaled nine-under 279 following a final round of 71 to secure his second runner-up finish on the PGTI.Ranjit Singh of Chandigarh, the joint overnight leader, submitted a card of 74 to claim third place at eight-under 280.Bengaluru’s M Dharma and Kapil Kumar of Delhi, the other two joint leaders after round three, shot scores of 75 to end the week in tied fourth place at seven-under 281.Twenty-two-year-old Karandeep Kochhar, who secured second place on the PGTI Order of Merit last year courtesy his two wins, made a slow start with two birdies and two bogeys on the front-nine as his approach shot on the eighth was the highlight having landed within six feet to set up a birdie.Alps Tour Golf - Ein Bay Open 2022Italian Stefano Mazzoli, 25, kept the overnight lead during the 3rd final round at Sokhna Golf Club battling head to head till the 17th hole with Irishman Conor Purcell  to claim the victory of the Ein Bay Open 2022, the first stage of the Alps Tour Season 2022.Mazzoli started his last round with 3 birdies on the first six holes but lost 2 shots on the 7th due to a double bogey. He came back on the back nine with 3 birdies on the last five holes. He scored just 3 bogeys and 1 double bogey during the whole tournament and saved strokes with 17 birdies and 1 eagle. He scored a total of 202 (69-65-68).“This is my second victory in Egypt (after 2020 Red Sea Little Venice Open) and the third on the Alps Tour (2021 Antognolla Alps Open). I’m very happy about my start, I’ve played very well during the week. Today I scored a bad double bogey on the 7th where I ended in the water hazard but then I came back soon. It was almost a matchplay between me and Conor until the 17th where we finished on the green with the second shot but I ended up making a birdie and Conor three-putted. I’m very happy with my start here for the first stage of the Tour”.Mazzoli earns a cheque of 5,800 euros and adds 6,525 points to lead the Order of Merit.The prize for the second place (3,940 euros) went to Irishman Conor Purcell, 24, who was in 6th place just 2 shots behind the leader after day 2.",

  "content": "PGA Tour - The Genesis InvitationalJoaquinn Niemann closed with an even-par 71 to become the first wire-to-wire winner of The Genesis Invitational in 53 years and the first player from Chile to break into the World Top 20.Staked to a three-shot lead, Niemann's margin was down to one when he made a 7-foot birdie on the eighth hole and PGA TOUR rookie Cameron Young sailed the green and made bogey.The 23-year-old from Chile chipped in for eagle on the par-5 11th to stretch his lead to five, and he held on for a two-shot victory over Open champion Collin Morikawa (65) and Young, whose last hopes ended with a bogey from the bunker on the 16th. Young shot 70.About the only thing Niemann missed was a chance to break the longest active tournament scoring record on the PGA TOUR. With two bogeys on the back nine, Niemann finished at 19-under 265, one short of the score Lanny Watkins had in 1985.Morikawa holed an eagle chip on the infamous and reachable 10th hole that one-hopped into the cup, and two late birdies gave him a chance. But he missed a 10-footer on the 18th in his bid to win and reach No. 1 in the world.Young, making only his 12th career TOUR start, was a runner-up for the second time this season. He also tied for second in Mississippi. Given the prestige of the tournament hosted by Tiger Woods, Young earned $1,068,000 for his tie for second. The purse was $12 million.As for Niemann, Riviera hasn't had a 23-year-old winner since Phil Rodgers in 1962, the tournament best known for Jack Nicklaus making his pro debut. Nicklaus tied for 50th and earned $33.33 that year.Sunshine and Challenge Tour - Bain's Whisky Cape Town OpenJC Ritchie successfully defended his Bain’s Whisky Cape Town Open title after holing a 25-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole for a one-stroke victory at Royal Cape Golf Club moving from World No. 288 to 196.The South African, who defeated countryman Jacques Blaauw in a play-off last year, retained his crown by posting a four under par round of 68 to reach 18 under par, one clear of Belgium’s Christopher Mivis, who raced through the field on the final day to set the target at 17 under par.It was Ritchie, however, who prevailed by responding to back-to-back dropped shots at the 13th and 14th with birdies at the 16th and 18th.“Words can’t describe this feeling, it’s awesome,” he said. “For how I felt on the golf course the last two days and to come out on top, it means everything to me.“I didn’t feel great. I wasn’t hitting the ball my best up until about Friday, when I felt unbelievable about my game. Then on Saturday, the wind threw me off a little, made a couple of bad shots and started feeling uncomfortable. I went and did some important work yesterday and I managed to hit the important shots well and managed to give myself a chance down 18.Korn Ferry Tour - LECOM Suncoast ClassicByeong Hun An emerged from the 2022 LECOM Suncoast Classic with his first TOUR-sanctioned victory and first worldwide win since 2015. An followed Saturday’s 4-under 67 with a 2-under 69 in Sunday’s final round, taking him to 17-under par for the week and securing a one-stroke victory over four different players at T2.“It was a long day,” An said. “I was grinding all day. Last hole was a bit unlucky, lucky and unlucky at the same time, but I got the job done and that’s what you need to do. I missed a lot of putts today, but grinded it out and just did enough to win out there.“I finally realized I don’t need to play four days of perfect golf. I had a mediocre day yesterday and today and still got away with this. It gives me a lot of confidence.”An was one of several players who held at least a share of the lead in the final round, but a 55-footer for birdie at the par-4 16th, the toughest hole Sunday on Lakewood National Golf Club’s Commander course, gave An a two-stroke advantage over a host of chasers.",

Cantlay, playing a group ahead of Scheffler, had a bogey-free 67.Scheffler broke through in his 71st PGA TOUR start. Before Sunday, the 25-year-old former University of Texas star's biggest professional highlights were beating Jon Rahm in September in United States' Ryder Cup victory at Whistling Straits and shooting a 59 in the 2020 THE NORTHERN TRUST.Scheffler and Cantlay matched pars on the first two extra trips down 18, with both players hitting the fairway and green the first time and both scrambling to save par on the second.Scheffler missed a chance to end it in regulation when his 5 1/2-foot birdie try slid right. On the stadium par-3 16th, he left a birdie putt 2 inches short.DP World Tour - The Ras Al Khaimah ClassicRyan Fox claimed his second DP World Tour victory as he eased to a five-shot win at 2022 Ras Al Khaimah Classic moving back into the Top 200 from World No. 211 to 119.The Kiwi had turned a two-shot first-round lead into a three-shot advantage at the midway point and he doubled that heading into day four at Al Hamra Golf Club.He saw the gap trimmed to two just after the turn as Pablo Larrazábal made a move but Fox signed for a 69 that moved him to 22 under and gave him an ultimately comfortable victory.England's Ross Fisher finished alone in second, a shot clear of Spaniard Larrazábal, South African Zander Lombard and German Hurly Long.Fox's victory is his first in a 72-hole stroke play event on the DP World Tour having claimed the 2019 ISPS Handa World Super 6 Perth title to go with two European Challenge Tour victories.He becomes the second wire-to-wire winner of the 2022 season after Thriston Lawrence, with the South African lifting the trophy at the weather-affected 36-hole Joburg Open.Korn Ferry Tour - Astara Golf Championship presented by MastercardBrandon Matthews claimed his first Korn Ferry Tour  title at the Astara Golf Championship presented by Mastercard with birdie-birdie-eagle finish moving to a career best of World No. 252.Brandon Matthews’ eagle-three at the par-5 18th of Country Club de Bogota’s Lagos course capped a birdie-birdie-eagle finish and a one-stroke victory.Matthews’ first Korn Ferry Tour victory came in his 50th Tour start. The 2020-21 PGA TOUR Latinoamérica Order of Merit winner, Matthews began the final round in T3 position and reached 19-under par for the week, one stroke ahead of runner-up finishers Ryan McCormick and Ben Griffin, with a 5-under 66 Sunday.PGA Tour of Australasia - Vic OpenDimitrios Papadatos, 30, produced a perfect six-under Sunday round of 66 to finish one shot clear of playing partner Ben Campbell at 20-under to claim his fifth professional victory and spot in the 150th Open Championship this year.The fans at 13th Beach were treated to an exquisite display of golf from Papadatos and New Zealander Campbell as they both went bogey free and continually placed one another under pressure.It was most prevalent on the dramatic final hole when Campbell’s shot from the green side bunker rolled to roughly three feet to all but guarantee a birdie and throw down the gauntlet to Papadatos that he would need to make a birdie to secure victory.Sunshine and Challenge Tour - Dimension Data Pro-AmAlexander Knappe secured his first win for  five years by posting four bogey-free rounds at the Dimension Data Pro-Am jumping 185 spots to World No.275.The German was calmness personified throughout his closing four under par round of 68 on the Montagu course at Fancourt Golf Estate, birdieing the last for a 23 under par total and a one-stroke victory over two-time DP World Tour winner Dean Burmester, who finished second on 22 under par after missing a birdie chance on the 72nd hole.Knappe was clearly emotional after securing his third Challenge Tour victory and was overjoyed by keeping his card clean throughout the first event of the season.“I’m really speechless, actually,” he said. “I’m settling down now so I can speak a little bit better but when I shook hands with Daniel, I couldn’t even say thank you for the round or anything, nothing came out. It’s just incredible to win this tournament, it means a lot to me.All Thailand Golf Tour - Singha E-San Open21 year old Atiruj Winaicharoenchai, finished the final round 5 under par 67 to claim his first All Thailand Golf Tour title finishing with a total score of 20 under par 268.

After both players rescued their errant playoff tee shots from a fairway bunker, List spun an exceptional 131-yard wedge approach shot to within a foot of the cup.After List tapped in and Zalatoris missed his 13-foot birdie putt, List celebrated in the gloaming with his wife, Chloe, while he held their daughter, Ryann.“She's been telling me for a long time, ‘Daddy, I want a trophy,’ and I finally got one,” the 37-year-old List said after breaking through in his 206th tour start.Zalatoris and List finished regulation at 15-under 273, setting up the fourth playoff in the last 11 years at the Farmers.

I'm really in control of my ball flight and it's nice to feel like that and making putts as well.

From 198 yards, he hit to 8 feet on the iconic hole with large, deep bunkers lining the left side.Swafford then ran in a 20-foot birdie putt on 17, a par-3 hole called Alcatraz with an island green ringed by jagged rocks. He saved par on the par-4 18th with an 8-footer.The 34-year-old finished at 23-under 265 in the three-course event for his third PGA TOUR title. He also won in the desert in 2017 and took the 2020 Corales Puntacana Resort & Club Championship.Hoge shot a 68. The 32-year-old from Fargo, North Dakota, missed a chance to win his first title in his 201st career start.Hodges, the 26-year-old from Alabama making his 14th PGA TOUR start, shot a 70 to tie for third at 20 under with Harman (64) and Lanto Griffin (67).Molinari, the Italian star who won the 2018 Open Championship, bogeyed the 18th for a 68. He tied for sixth with Will Zalatoris (67) and Denny McCarthy (67).Asian Tour - SMBC Singapore OpenThailand’s Sadom Kaewkanjana secured the biggest title of his fledging career when he won the SMBC Singapore Open at Sentosa Golf Club becoming the highest current Ranked Thai player at World No.148, a career best.Sadom, the joint-overnight leader, fired a composed bogey-free 69 on the Serapong Course to finish on 13 under and beat Japan’s Yuto Katsuragawa and Joohyung Kim from Korea by three strokes.Katsuragawa returned a 68 while Kim wrapped up the Asian Tour Order of Merit title after signing for 69.Sihwan Kim, who started the day sharing the lead, carded a 73 to take fourth place.All four players booked their tickets to this year’s Open Championship at St Andrews as this week’s event is part of the Open Qualifying Series.Sadom produced another inspired level of golf today that confirmed his status as one of hottest young golfers in the region and a star of the future.The 23 year old was never really challenged on an extremely hot day. After Sihwan Kim made bogey on the first Sadom took the outright lead and did not look back. Birdies on six and seven saw him move three ahead and he calmly parred his way home and enjoyed the comfort of a three-shot lead playing 18.He picked up a cheque for US$225,000 and finished the year in second place on the Merit list, with US$378,972.PGA Tour of Australasia – Queensland PGA ChampionshipGold Coast’s Anthony Quayle twice had to drag himself up off the canvas to complete a two-stroke victory in an enthralling final day of the Queensland PGA Championship in Brisbane.Boasting a six-stroke lead through 54 holes at Nudgee Golf Club, talk at the start of the day centred around whether Quayle might match Ossie Moore’s 10-stroke record winning margin from 1986 yet just five holes in it was tied at the top.Quayle made a disastrous start when he double-bogeyed the opening hole and when Sydney’s Justin Warren made three birdies in succession from the second hole the margin was down to one.The wheels might not have completely fallen off but Quayle did have to take his shoes off when his approach to the par-5 fifth came up short and in the hazard, the resulting bogey bringing him back level with Warren at 10-under.In the blink of an eye his lead had vanished into thin air yet a brilliant 5-iron to the par-4 sixth turned momentum back in Quayle’s favour, his birdie from close range and Warren’s double bogey after finding the hazard long of the green restoring a three-shot buffer.The margin was back out to five by the turn after Warren made bogey at both eight and nine but just as Quayle settled again a new contender emerged in Louis Dobbelaar.The nearest threat would ultimately come from Daniel Gale (66) in the group ahead but when Quayle safely navigated the treacherous tee shot at the par-3 18th the 2021 Queensland PGA Championship was finally secured, good friend Jake McLeod storming the 18th green to celebrate with a bottle of champagne.“It was more stressful than I thought it would be but it was a lot of fun,” Quayle conceded after a roller-coaster closing 73.As Warren was landing bombs early on the front nine, rising star Louis Dobbelaar continued to stay in the fight and when he picked up birdies at 12 and 13 the margin was again back to two.But Dobbelaar’s charge also ran out of steam, a three-putt from close range at 15 handing Quayle a three-shot buffer with three holes to play.The nearest threat would ultimately come from Daniel Gale (66) in the group ahead but when Quayle safely navigated the treacherous tee shot at the par-3 18th the 2021 Queensland PGA Championship was finally secured, good friend Jake McLeod storming the 18th green to celebrate with a bottle of champagne.Korn Ferry Tour - The Bahamas Great Exuma Classic at Sandals Emerald BayAkshay Bhatia wasted no time in making an impact as a Korn Ferry Tour member, winning The Bahamas Great Exuma Classic at Sandals Emerald Bay with a final-round, 7-under 65, finishing two strokes clear of Paul Haley II at 14-under total.
